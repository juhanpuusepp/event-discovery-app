# EVNTLY – Event Discovery App
Discover events around you through a map-based interface and as an organiser, add your own. The user can view nearby events filtered by categories. By clicking on an event, more details are presented. In addition, a calendar view also allows browsing upcoming events by date. The platform supports micro-payments for paid events, enabling users to purchase tickets directly within the app. Certified accounts can add their own occasions.

The app is written in **Kotlin language**, in **Android Studio** IDE. It is compiled and run by **Gradle**, with the UI being created by using the modern toolkit **Jetpack Compose**.

## Current Setup Instructions
- Clone the repository
- In local.properties file add line: MAPS_API_KEY=**key**

Right now, the API key could be generated by the user personally by following the instructions at https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/get-api-key or by requesting it from the project authors.
